###An Android app for discovering nearby InstagramÂ© posts. 

Thanks for stopping by. This is a sample project originally for playing around with [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) & [picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) library. But after connecting with Instagram API I think we could have more fun with a simple location based app. 

I'm adding more functions later on.

###Now we have

1. Discover nearby Instagram posts based on your device
2. Find out popular Instagram posts
3. Filter out nearby posts by adjusting search range in meters

###In progress

1. Android Wearable support
2. Notification based on your activity(walking/on_foot/on_transit)
3. Drop pin onto Googlemap for searching around that position
4. Other minor bugs

###Feedback
leave any comments or feature requests in the issue. 

##Happy #localsgramming
